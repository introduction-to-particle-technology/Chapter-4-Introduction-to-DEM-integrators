# Introduction to DEM Integrators

In this interactive example, we will show you how to code up a simple integration scheme, starting in 1D and then expanding to 2D. We will various aspects of numerical integrators, but in particular how altering the timestep can affect the accuracy of a simulation - an extremely important consideration in DEM, as the wrong value can make our models unphysical!

The examples are coded in Python, which is one of the more user-friendly programming languages, but can still be a bit daunting for those who have never coded before. If this is you, please remember that **it is not necessary to fully understand each line of code** - just the general gist of what we are trying to do in each individual "code block".
